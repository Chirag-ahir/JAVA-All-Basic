# JAVA-All-Basic

Java is a general-purpose and object oriented programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystem and released in 1995.

Public - It is an access specifier that means the main() method is accessible globally available. The public keyword tells the JVM that the scope of the code written is the whole project.

Static - It is an access modifier means we can call this method directly using the class name without creating an object of it.

Void - void is the return type. It means "this method returns nothing".

Main - It is the name of the method. The main method is the entry point of a Java program for the Java Virtual Machine(JVM). 

String args[] - It is array of string type and It stores Java command-line arguments. 

New keyword - In java, New keyword is basically used for creating objects. It allocates memory for an object.

Extend keyword - The extends keyword indicates that you are making a new class that derives from an existing class. The meaning of "extends" is to increase the functionality.

What is Method in JAVA ? <br>
A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.

What is System.in in Java?<BR>
System.in is an InputStream which is typically connected to keyboard input of console programs.

What is JAR File ?<br>
A Java™ ARchive (JAR) file is a file format that combines many files into one.

DataType : A data type, in programming, is a classification that specifies which type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational or logical operations can be applied to it without causing an error.

<b>Three types of variables in JAVA</b>

1. Local variables are declared in methods, constructors, or blocks.

2. Instance variables are declared in a class, but outside a method, constructor or any block.

3. Class variables also known as static variables are declared with the static keyword in a class, but outside a method, constructor or a block.

Array : Arrays are objects that store multiple variables of the same type.

What is Constructor ?<br>
A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created.

In Java, constructors can be divided into 3 types:<br>

No-Arg Constructor<br>
Parameterized Constructor<br>
Default Constructor

Java was a interpreted programming language , but after introducing JIT it was called as interpreted - compiled programming language<b>

  Advantages of JIT compiler : <br>
  1. The JIT compiler requires less memory usage <br>
  2. Code optimization can be done while the code is running.<br>
  3. It reduces the page faults.<br>
  4. It uses different levels of optimization.
  5. JIT increase the speed of program execution.

Features of JAVA:<br>
1.	Simple: JAVA is easy to learn and it’s syntax is quite simple, clean and easy to learn.<br>
2.	Object Oriented: In java everything is Object which has some data and behaviour.<br>
3.	Robust<br>
4.	Platform Independent: Java is guaranteed to be write-once, run-anywhere language. Not fully Independent. JVM is Platform Independent. <br>
5.	Secure: Java program always runs in Java runtime environment with almost null interaction with system OS, hence it is more secure.<br>
6.	Multi threading: Java multithreading feature makes it possible to write program that can do many tasks simultaneously.<br>
7.	Portable: Java Byte code can be carried to any platform.<br>
8.	Highly Performance: Java enables high performance with the use of just-in-time compiler.<br>
