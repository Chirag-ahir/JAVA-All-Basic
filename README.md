Public - It is an access specifier that means the main() method is accessible globally available. The public keyword tells the JVM that the scope of the code written is the whole project.

Static - It is an access modifier means we can call this method directly using the class name without creating an object of it.

Void - void is the return type. It means "this method returns nothing".

Main - It is the name of the method. The main method is the entry point of a Java program for the Java Virtual Machine(JVM). 

String args[] - It is array of string type and It stores Java command-line arguments. 

New keyword - In java, New keyword is basically used for creating objects. It allocates memory for an object.

DataType : A data type, in programming, is a classification that specifies which type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational or logical operations can be applied to it without causing an error.

<b>Three types of variables in JAVA</b>

1. Local variables are declared in methods, constructors, or blocks.

2. Instance variables are declared in a class, but outside a method, constructor or any block.

3. Class variables also known as static variables are declared with the static keyword in a class, but outside a method, constructor or a block.

Array : Arrays are objects that store multiple variables of the same type.

JDK : The JDK is a development environment for building applications and components using the Java programming language. 

JRE : JRE is responsible for providing a runtime environment only. JRE is a part of JDK.

What is Constructor ?
A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created.

In Java, constructors can be divided into 3 types:

No-Arg Constructor
