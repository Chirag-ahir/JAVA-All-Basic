# JAVA-All-Basic

DataType : A data type, in programming, is a classification that specifies which type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational or logical operations can be applied to it without causing an error.

<b>Three types of variables in JAVA</b>

1. Local variables are declared in methods, constructors, or blocks.

2. Instance variables are declared in a class, but outside a method, constructor or any block.

3. Class variables also known as static variables are declared with the static keyword in a class, but outside a method, constructor or a block.
